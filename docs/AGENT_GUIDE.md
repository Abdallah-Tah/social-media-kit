# Agent Guide

How the Social Media Agent works, and how to drive it.

## The routine

Every run executes the same disciplined loop — the agent decides each step,
the way Claude Code reasons and calls tools:

1. **Research** — `web_search` for 3-6 strong sources, `fetch_url` on the best.
2. **Write** — a full article in Markdown (not a template), grounded in those
   sources, with a Sources section. Saved via `save_article`.
2b. **Cover image** — `generate_cover` makes a hero image (FAL.ai → OpenAI →
   free branded card), returning a local path and a hosted URL.
3. **Adapt** — a *native* post per platform (X ≤ 280 chars, LinkedIn/Facebook
   a few paragraphs + CTA, Slack/Discord/Telegram concise, Mastodon ≤ 500).
4. **Publish** — calls the posting tool for each enabled channel + the blog,
   attaching the cover (URL → `publish_blog`, path → `post_facebook`).
5. **Report** — `finish` with a summary of what shipped and what was skipped.

The loop is bounded by `max_steps` (default 20) as a safety stop.

## Architecture (Claude Code-style)

```

The model never talks to a platform directly. It emits a **tool call**; the
`ToolBox` dispatches it to the matching script and feeds the result back. This
is exactly the tool-use loop Claude Code uses.

## Choosing a provider

`config/agent.yaml`:

```yaml
provider: anthropic   # anthropic | openai | ollama
anthropic: { model: claude-sonnet-4-6 }
openai:    { model: gpt-4o, base_url: https://api.openai.com/v1 }
ollama:    { model: llama3.1, base_url: http://localhost:11434/v1 }
```

Override per-run: `--provider ollama --model qwen2.5`.

- **anthropic** needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Use `claude-opus-4-8` for the best
  writing, `claude-sonnet-4-6` for speed/cost.
- **openai** needs `OPENAI_API_KEY`; point `base_url` at OpenRouter or any
  compatible endpoint to use other models.
- **ollama** needs nothing for local use. **Pick a model that supports tool
  calling** (e.g. `llama3.1`, `qwen2.5`, `mistral-nemo`, `kimi-k2.6`). Small or
  pure "thinking" models (e.g. `gemma3:4b`) will echo tool code as text instead
  of calling tools — avoid them.
  - **Ollama Cloud**: set `base_url: https://ollama.com/v1` in `agent.yaml`,
    put `OLLAMA_API_KEY` in `secrets.env`, and use the **base model name with
    no `:cloud` suffix** (the `:cloud` alias is an OpenClaw routing convention,
    not an ollama.com model id). The client also tolerates thinking models that
    return tool calls/prose in a `reasoning` field.

> **Web search** tries four providers in order — **Brave → SearXNG →
> DuckDuckGo → Wikipedia** — and uses the first that returns results:
> - `BRAVE_API_KEY` — best quality (free tier).
> - `SEARXNG_URL` — free, no key; self-host or point at any SearXNG instance.
> - DuckDuckGo — free, no key, but best-effort (can be rate-limited).
> - Wikipedia — free, no key, **always works out of the box** as a last resort.
> Force one with `SEARCH_PROVIDER=brave|searxng|duckduckgo|wikipedia`.

## Brand profiles

A profile is the agent's voice + guardrails. `platforms` is an allowlist — the
agent will not post anywhere it doesn't list. Run multiple brands by passing
`--profile <name>`.

## Brand DNA & history

- `smkit learn https://yoursite.com` fetches your site, asks the LLM to infer
  your voice/audience/topics, and writes `config/profiles/<name>.yaml`. Review
  and tweak it — it's a starting point, not gospel.
- Every real (non-dry-run) `run` is logged to `content/published.json`. The
  agent **won't re-publish a topic you've already shipped** unless you pass
  `--force`. View the log with `smkit history`.

## Repurpose & dashboard

- **`smkit repurpose <url|file>`** reads one existing piece (article, blog post,
  transcript, notes) and rewrites it into platform-native posts for every
  channel in the profile — no fresh research. "Create once, distribute
  everywhere." Honors dry-run and the channel allowlist like `run`.
- **`smkit dashboard`** starts a local browser control panel (stdlib only) at
  http://127.0.0.1:8800 — trigger runs, repurpose, preview drafts, and browse
  history without the CLI. It binds to localhost; it *can* publish live, so
  don't expose it to the network unintentionally.

## Blog platforms

Set `BLOG_PLATFORM` to `generic` (default), `wordpress`, or `ghost`:
- **generic** — POSTs JSON to `{BLOG_API_URL}/posts` (Laravel/custom).
- **wordpress** — `BLOG_API_URL` = site root, `BLOG_API_USER` + an Application
  Password as `BLOG_API_TOKEN`; posts via the WP REST API.
- **ghost** — `BLOG_API_URL` = site root, `BLOG_API_TOKEN` = Admin API key
  (`id:secret`); JWT is generated for you, posts via the Ghost Admin API.

## Dry-run vs live

- `--dry-run` simulates every publish/post (and still enforces hard limits like
  the 280-char tweet cap), so you can preview a full run safely.
- Live runs prompt for confirmation unless you pass `--yes`.
- Set `dry_run: true` in `agent.yaml` to make dry-run the default everywhere.

## Scheduling

1. Add topics (one per line) to `config/topics.txt`.
2. `smkit queue config/topics.txt --yes` runs the next topic and, on success,
   moves it to `config/topics.txt.done`.
3. Automate with cron:
   ```cron
   0 9 * * 1-5  cd /path/to/social-media-kit && smkit queue config/topics.txt --yes >> run.log 2>&1
   ```
4. Or use the included GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/scheduled-run.yml`) —
   put your keys in repo Secrets. It dry-runs by default; set the repo variable
   `GO_LIVE=1` (or trigger manually with dry-run off) to publish for real.

## Costs & safety

- One run ≈ a handful of model calls + a few HTTP requests. Local Ollama is free.
- The agent never fabricates facts — it grounds claims in fetched sources.
- If a channel isn't configured, it's skipped and noted, not failed.
- Nothing is committed or pushed by the agent itself except the topic queue in
  the scheduled workflow.
